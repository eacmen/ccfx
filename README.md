# CCFinderX on Recent Linux
===

This was forked in order to support compilation on a newer version of boost library. There was a single line preventing compilation that was patched. Also some much needed cleaning up was required since we are only interested in the cli interface for this utility.

CCFinderX is a code-clone detector which was originally developed by [Toshihiro Kamiya](http://toshihirokamiya.com/).

The source code is ported from [the archive of CCFinder Official Site](http://www.ccfinder.net/ccfinderxos.html), and is modified to build on Ubuntu 16.04 according [the installation instructions](http://nicolas-bettenburg.com/articles/how-to-compile-ccfinderx-under-ubuntu-linux/) by [Nicolas Bettenburg](http://nicolas-bettenburg.com/)
